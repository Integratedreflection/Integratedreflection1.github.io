<h2>Reflection:</h2>
<p>In my career proposal, I chose the career of software engineering. The feedback I received was minimal since there was only a slight issue with my voice recording. With that said, due to the format of this piece, the feedback can not be incorporated. For my portfolio piece, I have decided to code this very webpage, displaying what exactly a software engineer might do, and how that is done. This largely depends on what role in which company has been taken on, or what specialisation is pursued. Software engineering entails designing video games, managing databases, operating systems, or in the case of my portfolio, creating websites. The skills required to do this include:</p>
<ul>
     <li>Problem solving</li>
     <li>Knowledge of programming languages</li>
     <li>Analytical skills</li>
     <li>Patience</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the process of creating this webpage, I encountered a lot of problem solving. HTML, like all programming languages, contains lots of different types of characters on every single line. Even just one missing character can make your entire code dysfunctional. I had to overcome the hurdles of constantly making small mistakes in order to make the page work.</p>
<p>This closely links to analytical skills and patience. I had to utilise my analytical skills in order to actually find these mistakes and issues with my code. Only then can problem solving take place. Throughout the making of this piece, patience was highly required. The frustration of trying to run your code several times and an error occurring is almost unbearable. These are what skills are required of a software engineer, and exactly what I required whilst coding this page, revealing my effective demonstration of the career path. My portfolio piece has a weakness. This is its simplicity. Despite my chosen career path and my display of what skills are required, I did not have the adequate knowledge, nor ability to reciprocate a code that is even close to the complexity of that to a professionally made website. This is where I feel I lack detail in explaining what is actually done in software engineering. On the other hand, I found the most creative way I could to communicate the skillful works of software engineering. Putting my reflection as part of my portfolio makes everything so much more connected and pushes me to include the components of my chosen career all throughout the assessment task.</p>
